# FiXer Twitter Link Replacer Bot

FiXer is a Discord bot that detects Twitter/X links in messages and replaces them with alternative front-end links like fixvx.com or vxtwitter.com. It deletes the original message and re-posts the modified one.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a `.env` file with your bot token.
3. Run `main.py`.
